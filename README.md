# Simple-Budgeting-App-Server


### This is all codes for the back-end part, and this connects to the front-end part 
<br> 

## Currently it can only be used to perform add income and add expense only, then it will calculate the balance

### This only has two endpoints: for addition and for showing all budget history

### This is made using expressJS, pg, and postgreSQL database
<br>

### It can be called from the client , which code's are shown on my other repository: Simple-Budgeting-App-Client
